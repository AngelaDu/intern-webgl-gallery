# intern-we3-webgl-gallery

Welcome WE3 devs!

Interactive and realtime artworks have become very popular with the rise of NFT's. Platforms now give artists the ability to sell their creations for crypto currency.

For your starting project we would like you to create a WebGL gallery website.

This project can be broke down in two tasks:

1. Create the website interface

* Create an index page which shows thumbnails of each artwork with a text description.
* Create a gallery page which showcases each of your indivisual artworks example: `/gallery/artwork-1` `/gallery/artwork-2` etc

Please use the Jam3 [nextjs boilerplate](https://github.com/Jam3/nextjs-boilerplate) as the framework.
  
2. Creating the artworks:

We encourage you to use whichever web technology your interested in or want to learn. 

Some popular libraries include:

 * [threejs](https://threejs.org/)
 * [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
 * [pixijs](https://www.pixijs.com/)
 
We recommend you spending at least half a day thinking about what artwork you would like to create, why it's important and which technology is right to execute it.
